                        <p>After completing my Bachelor's Degree in Music Business with a concentration in Jazz Trumpet at the Crane School of Music, I was offered the chance to study with Dizzy Gillespie's apprentice, Jon Faddis at Purchase College to pursue my Master of Music. After completing my education, I briefly worked in the music industry and realized that I did not want to be a part of the business side of music. I just wanted to play my instrument for fun! Shortly after this, I began working at Georgia State University as an Academic Advisor for students within the College of the Arts. After a few months, I began to CRAVE the chance to utilize my creative problem solving skills. This is when I discovered Free Code Camp.</p>
                        <p>After writing my first lines of HTML and CSS, I was absolutely hooked! I began to start working countless nights through Free Code Camp, and various udemy courses to learn as much as I could on my own. After 4 months of self teaching front-end web development, I decided that I wanted to pursue Full Stack Development. After coming to this conclusion, I realized that I needed formal training to refine my propgramming skills so I could potentially land a job as a Software Engineer.</p>
                        <p>This is when I decided to quit my full-time job to attend DigitalCrafts, a coding bootcamp where I am currently studying JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Redux, Node.js, Python, and other development technologies. While I still love to play my trumpet, I truly believe I have found my calling as a Software Engineer.</p>
                        <p>I am absolutely thrilled to say that I am now a Full Stack Developer! I can't wait to utilize my past experience in creative problem solving, improvisation and building personal relationships to excel on a team as a Software Engineer.</p>
